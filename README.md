This project explores Toronto licensed childcare centers focusing on the operation and the capacity of these centers for various age groups. The analysis is guided by the following questions: 

Research question 1: Is there a statistically significant difference in the total childcare spaces among different operating agencies in Toronto, considering the challenges associated with high fees and low availability of childcare spaces? To respond to the research question, one-way ANOVA test has been employed as it allows for the examination of variations in means across different operating agencies.

Research question 2.1.: Is there a statistically significant joint effect of having a fee subsidy contract and being part of a CWELCC program on the total childcare spaces available for all age groups in childcare centers? Research question 2.2: Do fee subsidy contracts and CWELCC program interact in a way that significantly influences the variation in childcare spaces? A two-way ANOVA has been employed to respond to research questions 2.1 and 2.2.
